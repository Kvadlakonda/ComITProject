           <p> Do you want to promote your business? Do you have a family reunion that you want a special moment for? You are in luck, because we now offer custom screen print on tote bags, as well as embroidery. </p>

            <p>Having the ability to customize your bag can open a world of opportunity. Screen printed tote bags make great gifts, as well as promotional items. We take the guess work out of customizing, making it super easy for you to accomplish your tote bag vision. We offer both screen printing and embroidery application.</p>
            
            <p>It has never been so easy to get the custom tote bags you have been wanting. Customizing a bag is great for business promotions, weddings, family reunions, birthdays, and so much more.</p>
            
            <p>The minimum order for our print screen and embroidery service is 12 bags. Customization can be applied to one or both sides, but you will have to double the quantity to reflect a double side application. For example, if you are ordering 60 bags and want print on both sides, you then need to choose a quantity of 120.</p>
            
            <p>Your design may have single or multiple colors. At this time, we allow up to 5 different colors for screen printing with a single design. Once you choose the custom tote bag you wish to customize there will be a print service button. Click on it, and choose how many colors you wish to use. It is very important that you choose 3 if there are 3 colors in your design, as this will affect the price of the tote bag.  Changing thread color for custom embroidery is offered as well at no additional cost.</p>
            
            <p>Print your company logo on tote bags by sending us your logo or artwork image file that you wish to apply to your bag, and we will do the rest. Your design will bring professionalism and creativity to your bag, allowing you to stand out among a crowd.</p>
            
            <p>Our screen printing is placed on to the tote bag by the use of a heat-bonded process. This allows your colored design or logo to be place without harming the material of the bag in any way. Just another way we ensure you get a quality outcome that you are satisfied with.</p>
            
            <p>There are no set up fees when you choose us for your screen printing and embroidery tote bag customization.

Its easy to see why you should choose us, as we will provide you with the custom design you desire with out all the added fees.</p>
            
            <p>Once design is approved, your order can be progressed in 5 to 7 business days. Its never been so easy to print your logo on tote bags. These make the perfect  promotional tote bags, which can be given to customers or employees. All of this can be achieved easily and quickly.</p>
